TODO:
- Make settings class
  - Reads from file
    - Preferably a .config file
  - Writes to file
    - To write it first reads the file, then writes the new settings to the file if they are different from the old ones or
      if the setting doesn't exist

  - Ideas for settings:
    - Language
    - Theme
    - Window size
    - Window state (maximized, minimized, normal, position)
