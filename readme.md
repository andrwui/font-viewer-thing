# This project is not longer maintained

## Why?

The goal for this project was to make a free and open source font manager, but as the back end requirements of the application were scaling at a very rapid pace, and I don't that much free time, I've decided to build a web version of the app instead of the desktop app.

## What now?

Instead of a Font Manager desktop app, the app will be changed to a web application.
Although the web version of the app won't have all the system-fonts-related features I had in mind, I'm planning to focus on other features and tools focusing UI Development and UI Design.

## Where is the web version?

The web version of The Font App can be found on [This repo]().

Thank you all ❤️.
